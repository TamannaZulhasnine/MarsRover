Use the NASA API described here to build a project that calls the Mars Rover Photos API with a given day as input, returning corresponding photo images as output. The application should download and store each image locally.

The list of dates below, which is stored in text file "dates.txt", to pull the images that were captured on that date, by reading dates one-by-one from the file: 02/27/17 June 2, 2018 Jul-13-2016 April 31, 2018

The downloaded file has been Found in C:\MarsRover
